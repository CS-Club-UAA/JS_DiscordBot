# CS Club DiscordBot

Welcome! 

This respository is dedicated to a custom Discord bot that Computer Science Club (CS Club) at the University of Alaska Anchorage manages. The repository will hold code that members of the club throughout the years modified to add funtionality to their own discord server!

# Member of CS Club & Documentation

If you are a current member, please feel free to pull the files from this repository to incorporate to your personal projects or even help develop the bot even further. If you decide to help please talk with any of the current CS Club officers so they can add you  to the repository.

As far as documentation goes, the code should be commented and this was initially developed during a meeting session. Hence, ask to the current President of the club for the video link or slides to refer how you may start to develop your own bot!
